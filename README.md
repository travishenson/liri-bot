## LIRI's Functions
LIRI has four functions. Three of them take in a user's input, whereas the fourth function is more random and pulls its function parameters from a specified txt file.

The three user-input functions are `concert-this`, `spotify-this-song`, and `movie-this`. The fourth (random function) is `do-what-it-says`.
